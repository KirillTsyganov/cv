## Professional Experience

### Senior ML Engineer | AustralianSuper | 2023-current

- Platform Transformation: Led the architectural uplift and full scale transformation of enterprise grade AI/ML platform on Azure, uplifting IaC (Terraform) code base, ultimately maximising business value through data and models utilisation.

- Accelerated ML Delivery: Engineered robust ML pipelines, utilising parallelisation on horizontally scalable compute, leveraged Spark engine for faster feature engineering, and exposed models as REST endpoints. Operationalised 4 strategic business use cases, and accelerated investment decision making.

- Operational Excellence: Served as the subject matter expert (SME) for both the Funds AI/ML platform and MLOps practices at the Fund, increasing engineering efficiency and reducing operational risk at Fund.

- Stakeholder Engagement: Carried a people centric approach to align and educate technical and business stakeholders on data driven decision making, driving horizontal collaboration to successfully deliver end to end AI/ML solutions across multiple business arms.

### Data Scientist | National Australian Bank (NAB) | 2021-2023

- Led technical development of climate data initiatives using Databricks' Medallion architecture, transforming raw data into a business consumable form, that provided the first holistic view of financed emissions. Successfully aligned technical deliverables with organisational sustainability goals

- Implemented and maintained enterprise-wide dashboards that enhanced competitive intelligence and decision-making for ESG strategy, which were used for reporting to the board and regulators

- Established robust documentation frameworks and engineering best practices, resulting in a more transparent, reproducible and faster overall development process

- Led end-to-end ML initiatives from business requirements to production deployment, delivering 10 XGBoost models that streamlined business processes

### Bioinformatician | Monash Bioinformatics Platform, Monash University | 2015-2021

- High-Throughput 'Omics' Expertise: Deep experience in analysing individual Genomics assays, including RNA-seq, ChIP-Seq, Hi-C, and integrating multiple omics data together to consistently deliver actionable biological insights from complex and noisy high-throughput sequencing data, directly supporting scientific publications.

- Advanced Analytics and Technical Skill: Designed, built, and deployed scalable, reproducible bioinformatics tools, packages and pipelines to process diverse, high-throughput sequencing data, using domain specific languages (BigDataScript and Nextflow) alongside with python, R and Linux shell scripting.

- HPC and Cloud Integration: Proven expertise in leveraging AWS and High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources to process large volumes of genomic data. Worked with DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for pipeline process flow and optimised SLURM queue parameters for efficient, unique genomics workloads.

- Technical Leadership & Operational Standards: Acted as a technical lead and researchers liaison, guiding experimental design for new research (bacterial or mammalian genomics). Drove operational excellence through reproducible research, uplifting research community practices by regularly engaging in workshops, providing sample code and workflows templates and documentations.

### Duty Manager | Yarra Leisure, City of Yarra | 2009-2014

 - Supervise and assist all centreâ€™s programs including group fitness classes, gym and aquatic areas
- Provide direction and support to all staff on duty, for example customer complains resolution
- Fulfil administrative tasks such as rostering, data entry and daily takings handling
- Responsible for aquatic area operations inline with health regulation
- Deliver high standard of customer service in person, over the phone and electronically

## Selected Projects

> Built a BCP model to predict daily crediting rates in the absence of external data feeds (JP Morgan).

- Delivered a linear regression model on AzureML with 98% accuracy.
- Automated deployment via Azure DevOps, including CI/CD and monitoring.
- Integrated output with Azure Data Factory for writeback into the central warehouse.

### Home Loan Benchmarks | NAB

> Enabled bankers to assess home loan applications faster through benchmarked expense predictions.

- Developed and deployed 10 XGBoost models for expense category prediction.
- Built ETL pipelines to manage feature engineering and benchmark generation.
- Managed SIT/PPTE testing environments on NAB's internal NDC platform.

### DNA methylation | Monash University

> Explored non-cytosine methylation in bacteria using high-performance computing and custom analytics.

- Built methylation site classifier using GPU-accelerated models.
- Performed genome assembly (short/long read) and motif discovery.
- Developed scalable workflows for SLURM-based HPC clusters.
